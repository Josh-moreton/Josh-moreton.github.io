				<h2>Cybersecurity as <strong>easy</strong> as a burgler alarm.</h2>
				<p>Consumers find cybersecurity complicated and inaccessible. Cybercrime is on the rise. AI is accelerating the trend. With the issue  becoming more urgent, the early majority are beginning to care. The weakest link is SMEs, individuals, and home users.  People who neither understand nor trust tech to solve the problem. People who need an affordable, effective cybersecurity solution.</p>
